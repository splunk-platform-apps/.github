# Action for Gold Standard Assessment
This action aims automatically assessing your Splunk Add-on compliance with the so called Gold Standard. A score will be returned as response to its project evaluation.

The purpose of the standard is defining best practices that lay the foundation for successful Splunk Technology Add-on (TA) development. By complying with it, your TA aligns with Splunk's highest standards, enhances compatibility and facilitates long-term maintainability.
